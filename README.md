# Before you get started 

For this project, the following libraries were used:
* Apollo client
* Graphql
* Material UI 
* Dayjs
* React
* React Router
* Jest
* Ffmpeg
* Body-parser
* Express
* Express-fileupload
* Nodemon

#

<b>Please follow the instructions below to get the app up and running.</b>

#### Run the following command anywhere:
##### `brew install ffmpeg`

#### Run the following command from both the <i>client</i> and <i>server</i> directories directory:
##### `npm start`
You should now be able to access the application at `http://localhost:3000/`

#

#### Considerations
I attempted to do as much as I could with the time given. There are a few things that if given more time I would have liked to do:

* Spend a little more time getting the page to design specs 
* Given podcast data, get podcast episodes to play when clicking on character cards 
* Fix some responsive issues for smaller screens 
* Design a better audio file conversion API
* Make use of the Material UI library for the file upload form
